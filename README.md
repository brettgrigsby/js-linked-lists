## Linked List Template

This template provides a starting point for implementing
a linked list. It is set up for unit testing with Mocha
and test assertions with Chai.

You can find more information about mocha and chai in their
documentation:

* [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)
* [Chai](http://chaijs.com/)

### Getting Started

* Clone the project
* Open the `test.html` file to see the tests.

For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/turingschool-examples/js-linked-list.git
cd js-linked-list
open test.html
```

The mocha tests will run automatically in the browser when viewing
the included `test.html` page.

Included files and directories:

* `lib/` - dependencies, including mocha and chai.
* `test.html` - test runner file; will pull in your other files and run
  the tests
* `linked_list.js` - put your linked list code here
* `linked_list_test.js` - write your tests here
